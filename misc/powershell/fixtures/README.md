# What is a test fixture?

A test fixture is a fixed setup of objects used as a baseline for running tests. It provides a known environment for testing and helps ensure repeatable, reliable results. Using test fixtures can validate software functionality, identify and isolate problems early, and improve the efficiency of the development process, leading to better software.

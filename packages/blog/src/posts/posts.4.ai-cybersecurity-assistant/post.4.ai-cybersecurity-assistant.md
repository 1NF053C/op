# <u>The Problem</u>

As a cybersecurity learner looking to build your skills in an online community like Discord, you're up against a tough enemy. Your ability to direct your attention effectively towards quality educational resources. Information overload and a constantly evolving threat landscape. These challenges make it difficult to keep up and leave you unprepared when it comes to real-world scenarios. Traditional learning resources may not be enough, and the enemy is always evolving, making it difficult to keep up with the latest threats and techniques.

# <u>Why now?</u>

The cybersecurity landscape is rapidly changing and the demand for skilled professionals is outpacing supply. Failing to act will lead to more severe threats and consequences such as data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage. This is some serious stuff, but it doesn't mean we can't have some fun while we're at it.

Defending our digital lives from nefarious attacks can feel like trying to dodge raindrops in a hurricane or trying to teach a goldfish how to play chess - it's gonna be a wild ride, but we'll get there. So let's roll up our sleeves, fire up our neural networks, and get cracking on building a rock-solid cybersecurity workforce.

# <u>Future</u>

Imagine a tireless and infinitely patient mentor, always ready to answer your questions and provide guidance as you navigate the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape. Information that is presented to you in ways that lets you use it effectively. 

# <u>Obstacles</u>

- Getting the mentor in front of you
- Money
- Maintenance

A tireless mentor needs to know where and when to receieve your questions and provide you answers. Easily digestible nuggets of wisdom that are inaccessible aren't useful to you. Your answers need to be where you already spend your time and attention.

A tireless mentor assisting you day and night will cost above zero dollars.

Mentors still need mentors. A mentor needs to continuously improve to keep up with the latest threats and techniques. This requires expertise in cybersecurity education, natural language processing, and chatbot development. The cost of this ongoing effort to maintain a tireless mentor can be a challenge for individuals and organizations alike, making it a significant obstacle in the cybersecurity learning journey.

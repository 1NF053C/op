# <u>The Problem</u>

As a cybersecurity learner looking to build your skills, you're up against a tough enemy. Information overload in a constantly evolving threat landscape. Traditional learning resources are helpful but not enough to keep up with the latest threats and techniques.

# <u>Why now?</u>

The cybersecurity landscape is rapidly changing and the demand for skilled professionals is outpacing supply. Failing to act will lead to more severe threats and consequences such as data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.

# <u>A Future</u>

Imagine a tireless and infinitely patient coach, always ready to answer your questions, quiz you on relevant subject matter, and provide information as you navigate the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape. Information that is presented to you in a way that is useful.

# <u>Obstacles</u>

There are some fun problems to solve between now and that future.

- Location choice
- Financial cost
- Maintenance and enhancements

A tireless coach needs to know where and when to receive your questions and provide you with guidance or quizzes.

A tireless coach working for you day and night will cost above zero dollars. Information needs to be affordable.

Coaches still need coaches. A cybersecurity coach needs to continuously improve to keep up with the latest threats and techniques.

# <u>Evidence of progress so far</u>

Location choice:
- Discord for reach

Financial cost:
- Open source software

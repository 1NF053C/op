# <u>The Problem</u>

As a cybersecurity learner looking to build your skills in an online community like Discord, you're up against a tough enemy. Information overload in a constantly evolving threat landscape. Traditional learning resources are helpful but not enough to keep up with the latest threats and techniques.

# <u>Why now?</u>

The cybersecurity landscape is rapidly changing and the demand for skilled professionals is outpacing supply. Failing to act will lead to more severe threats and consequences such as data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage. This is some serious stuff, but it doesn't mean we can't have some fun while we're at it.

# <u>A Future</u>

Imagine a tireless and infinitely patient mentor, always ready to answer your questions and provide guidance as you navigate the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape. Information that is presented to you in a way that is useful.

# <u>Obstacles along the way</u>

- Location
- Money
- Maintenance and enhancements

A tireless mentor needs to know where and when to receive your questions and provide you with guidance or quizzes. Information that is inaccessible isn't use to you. Your answers need to be where you already spend your time and attention.

A tireless mentor assisting you day and night will cost above zero dollars.

Mentors still need mentors. A mentor needs to continuously improve to keep up with the latest threats and techniques.

# <u>Evidence of progress so far</u>

Location:
- Discord for reach

Money:
- Rate-limiting API calls
- Future: Offer commercial licenses / Accept sponsors and donations

Maintenance:
- Open source model
